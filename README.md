You are given 2 numbers n and m, the task is to find n√m (nth root of m). If the root is not integer then return -1.

Examples :

Input: n = 3, m = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: 23 = 8
Input: n = 3, m = 9
Output: -1
Explanation: 3rd root of 9 is not integer.
Input: n = 4, m = 16
Output: 2
Explanation: 24 = 16
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 9
0 ≤ m ≤ 20
